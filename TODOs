flint hatchet:
(shapeless)
flint= F
stick= S
plant fiber= P

F S
F P

plant fiber is a 5% drop from any leaf or grass block while mining with flint

fire starter:
(shapeless)
(any) wood log= W
stick= S
plant fiber= P

W S
S P

fire starter creates a primitive, temporary campfire that burns out after a short while. has a 1 in 4 chances to fail and break.
use on the ground to create the fire, burns out after 90 seconds and can be kept going by placing burnables into it.
slowly cooks food on it, can char logs into tough wood and then charcoal if for too long.

to make a crafting table you need 2 logs
and 2 bricks, you can make bricks by getting clay and then crafting a raw brick (2 clay balls) then letting it sit to dry which takes 10 minutes
logs= L
bricks= b
L L
b b

wood tools need tough wood to make, original recipes removed.
mine stone which with a wood pick to get cobble stone (breaking a stone block does not break it, to break you must break it again)
but you want to take 2 flint and smash it against the cobblestone which can destroy the flint but sometimes give you 1 rock
take 1 rock in your offhand and another in your main hand and start smashing them together with right click on a cobble stone

stone tools require knapped rocks to make, original recipes removed.

after you get stone tool then you can mine stone regularly, coal, copper (which drops raw copper nuggets with stone), you can make a brick furnace which smelts 3 times slower than a regular furnace.

brick furnace:
brick blocks= B
nothing= #

B B B
B # B
B B B

craft raw copper nuggets into regular raw copper 3x3, then you can smelt that and get a copper ingot and mine iron, with iron it works the same way.

regular furnace:
smooth stone: S
iron ingot: i

S S S
S # S
S i S

diamonds break into fragments which you can recraft into a diamond like so:|
Diamond fragment= F
F F
F F

once you acquire diamonds you can mine copper and iron normally, and with netherite you can mine diamonds normally.
